Thanks, we see:


Version contains large components (0.0.0.9000)

Make a more reasonable version number. That is meant as a pre-release number by devtools, I believe.



The Title field should be in title case, current version then in title case:
'Climate data from Wang and Dillon, NCC 4, 988-922, 2014'
'Climate Data from Wang and Dillon, NCC 4, 988-922, 2014'

And perhaps stop after "Dillon" as the full reference is in the Description.


* checking examples ... NONE

Please add small example, at least.

Best,
Uwe Ligges
