Title: Estimating Magnitudes and Biological Impacts of Temperature Cycling
Version: 1.0.0
Authors@R: person("George", "Wang", email = "biogeek@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: This package provides tools for spectral analysis of temperature
    records. collects tools and methods from from Wang and Dillon 2014, Nature
    Climate Change 4, 988-992. Additionally, it provides tools to obtain and
    preprocess temperature records close to a geographic location, and generate
    test signals from spectral data. Custom functions have been replaced with tools
    available from other packages as they become available, so in some ways this has
    become a metapackage of current tools.
